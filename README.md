# Facebook Group Chat Member Collector

Gets data (name, people in chat etc.) about all of the user's group chats and puts them into database.db when threadCollector.py is run

readDb.py can be used to check which people are in a particular chat, as well as all of the chats in the database

WIP, I'm planning to use this to create a venn diagram or something of which people share which chats
